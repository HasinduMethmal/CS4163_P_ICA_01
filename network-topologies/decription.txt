Create a hierarchical network composed of three layers: 
    Core Layer – Minimum of 2 core routers or switches. 
    Aggregation/Distribution Layer – Minimum of 3 devices. 
    Access Layer – Minimum of 4 access switches.

Step 1: Create devices:
    Add 2 core routers.
    Add 3 distribution switches.
    Add 4 access switches.
    minimum 2 device each switch

Step 2: Interconnect devices:

    Use high-speed links (Gigabit Ethernet) for core-distribution connections.
    Use Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet for distribution-access connections.
